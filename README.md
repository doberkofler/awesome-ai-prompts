## General Meta-Prompts

| Name | Description | Prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Epistemic reset | Forces separation of fact from inference | “What do you actually know vs. assume here?” |
| Assumption audit | Surfaces hidden priors before they compound | “List every assumption embedded in your last response.” |
| Steelman the opposite | Breaks confirmation bias | “What’s the strongest case against your current approach?” |
| Constraint surfacing | Catches over-engineering and scope creep | “What are you optimizing for, and did anyone ask you to?” |
| Uncertainty declaration | Prevents hallucination laundering | “Rate your confidence per claim and flag what you’d need to verify.” |
